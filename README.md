# Steps to Push Changes to GitHub

This file contains instructions for pushing changes to GitHub.

## Instructions

1. **Stage Changes:**  
   Use the following command to stage all changes in your working directory:  
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

2. **Commit Changes:**  
   Add a commit message to describe your changes:  
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```

3. **Pull Remote Changes:**  
   To avoid conflicts, pull any changes from the remote repository:  
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

4. **Resolve Merge Conflicts (If Any):**  
   If conflicts occur:  
   - Open the conflicting files in your editor.  
   - Resolve the conflicts manually.  
   - Stage the resolved files:  
     ```bash
     git add <file-name>
     ```  
   - Finalize the merge:  
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts and complete merge"
     ```

5. **Push Changes:**  
   Push your changes to the remote branch:  
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

## Notes
- Always pull remote changes before making new commits to minimize conflicts.  
- Use `git status` to check the state of your working directory.  
- For detailed merge conflict resolution, refer to the Git documentation.
